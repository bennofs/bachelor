abstract="Huge RDF datasets are currently exchanged on textual RDF formats, hence consumers need to post-process them using RDF stores for local consumption, such as indexing and SPARQL query. This results in a painful task requiring a great effort in terms of time and computational resources. A first approach to lightweight data exchange is a compact (binary) RDF serialization format called HDT. In this paper, we show how to enhance the exchanged HDT with additional structures to support some basic forms of SPARQL query resolution without the need of ''unpacking'' the data. Experiments show that i) with an exchanging efficiency that outperforms universal compression, ii) post-processing now becomes a fast process which iii) provides competitive query performance at consumption.",
